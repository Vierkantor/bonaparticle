# Creating magazines with LaTeX and _bonaparticle_

**Using LaTeX to produce magazines that look just as well as those made using Adobe’s InDesign is way harder than it should be. You don’t want to mess around with arcane (La)TeX commands – you just want to create something that looks  nice, with as little effort as possible. _bonaparticle_ helps you do exactly that, by offering an easy to extend and use LaTeX class, and a handy build script.**
