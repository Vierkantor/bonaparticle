# Creating magazines with LaTeX and Bonaparticle

**Using LaTeX to produce magazines that look just as well as those made using Adobe’s InDesign is way harder than it should be. You don’t want to mess around with arcane (La)TeX commands – you just want to create something that looks  nice, with as little effort as possible. Bonaparticle helps you do exactly that, by offering an easy to extend and use LaTeX class.**

## Built using Bonaparticle

### Vakidioot

The [Vakidioot](https://www.a-eskwadraat.nl/Vereniging/Commissies/vakid/) is a student-run bi-monthly magazine published by [A–Eskwadraat, the study association for students in Physics, Mathematics, Computer Science, and Information Science at Utrecht University](https://www.a-eskwadraat.nl/). Coincidentally, the Vakidioot also serves as the main beta tester of the Bonaparticle class.

## Frequently asked questions

#### Why “Bonaparticle”? How does one even pronounce that?
Bonaparticle is an amalgamation of “(Napoléon) Bonaparte” and “article”. The Bonaparticle class is mainly intended for magazine _articles_ and the author of the class sometimes [plays as France in Sid Meier’s Civilization V](http://civilization.wikia.com/wiki/Napoleon_(Civ5)), but other than that, there’s no real reason for naming it Bonaparticle. Other names that were considered are “PolyTeX” (which would’ve been nice if this was developed at a [polytechnic university](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_of_technology), but it’s not), “CalTeX” (which would’ve been nice if this was developed at [Caltech](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Institute_of_Technology), but that isn’t the case either), and the very generic and unassuming name “magazine”.

#### I’m lazy. Can you show me some example output?
Of course! However, development and all related activities are usually only done during the weeks in which the final proofs of the Vakidioot are produced. Come back in a month or so, and there’ll probably be some example output awaiting you here. :-)

#### When can we expect some real documentation?
The first reasonably feature-complete and bug-free version isn’t expected until February 2016, so probably around then. If you are comfortable wading through LaTeX code, you can read the comments in `bonaparticle.cls` for now, or send me questions via email.

## License
`bonaparticle.cls` is licensed under the [The MIT license](LICENSE.md). I’m not exactly sure which license applies to the Frutiger files, so those’ll most likely be removed from this repository in the near future.
